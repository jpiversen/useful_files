# LF normalization
# ==============================================================================
# Auto detect text files and perform LF normalization. Git will convert text 
# files to OS's line ending on checkout and back to LF on commit automatically.

# Union merging
# ==============================================================================
# Using union merge ensures that these files don't lead to merge conflicts, but 
# instead are merged together keeping changes from both versions of the file. 
# However, do use with care as this setting can lead to duplicate entries.
